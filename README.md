*   **Reason for Sharing:** The Face Data is shared strictly to perform the service requested by the user: to analyze facial aesthetics and generate a "looksmaxing" report or rating.

*   **Local Storage:** Photos remain on your device's local storage and are under your control.
*   **No Server Storage:** We do not upload your photos or Face Data to Appterra servers for long-term storage.
*   **Security:** Account information is stored securely using industry-standard encryption practices. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
